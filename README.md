This is Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data, merged by person, vehicle and accident characteristics.

Original data file link: https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars

Please refer to the codebook in the FTP to find out what each variable means.

Disclaimer: The original data is from NHTSA. I merely merged the data using VIN through SAS, so as to help other researchers hoping to use this data for relevant research. 

Although created through SAS, the data is in .csv format.
