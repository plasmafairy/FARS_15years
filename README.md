This is Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data, merged by person, vehicle and accident characteristics.

FARS data contains all fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States, and this data is for the 15 years since 2000.

Please refer to the codebook in the FTP to find out what each variable means.

Disclaimer: The original data is from NHTSA. I merely merged the data through SAS, so as to help other researchers hoping to use this data for relevant research. 

Although created through SAS, the data is in .csv format.
